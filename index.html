      <h2>Reference Creator Experiment</h2>
      <p class="justified">This is an experiment to create a no frameowrk single file self contained html to create
        references in APA 7 style and also print them in text to be used for assignments.</p>
      <a href="./reference-creator">Check The Site</a>
      Or
      <a href="./reference-creator-docs"> Docs</a>
      <p> The goal of the experiment was to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[Done] Use DOM functions.</li>
        <li>[50%] Use styling like plain paper journal page.</li>
        <li>[Done] Put all files in one file and organize them for development.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The outcome of experiment was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>DOM functions and event listeners were utilized well.</li>
        <li>Explore minimal CSS frameworks like PicoCSS, Bootstrap etc for styling.</li>
        <li>Prefer utilities and libraries like Lodash, Preact, etc to make dev easy. Both with build tools and without
          build tools we can get lot of benefits.</li>
      </ol>
